	  A: No need to worry. Investing over a long time period is very safe. In fact, there has been no 20 year period where you would've lost money by investing in a stock fund.

			<p>The absolute worst case was if you had invested in 1929 –  the year of the stock market crash followed by the 10-year Great Depression. If you invested $100 in 1929, you would've ended up with $102.50 in 1949. Bummer, but given the disastrous economy, it's reassuring that you still wouldn't have lost money!</p>
<br />
			<p>Outside of that one year – people who invested $100 in any other year got anywhere between $290 – $2,700 at the end of 20 years. </p>
<br />
			<p>If you invest for a long time period, you will not lose money. And more importantly, you will substantially grow your money.</p>
