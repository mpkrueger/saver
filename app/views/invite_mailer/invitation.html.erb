<p><b>Why Savvy?</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Most people overpay for their cable and internet. That stinks. </li>
    <li>Most people don't want to negotiate with their cable/internet companies. Understandable. </li>
    <li>There's real savings at stake â€“ on average, Savvy saves people $300/year. Seriously.</li>
    <li>There's nothing to lose. You pay 1/3 of what Savvy saves you in the first year and you keep the rest.</li>
  </ul>

<p>Join <%= @customer.first_name %> and start saving some money today!</p>

<p>Happy savings,<br />
Savvy</p>
